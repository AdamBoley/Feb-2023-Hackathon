# Scope


# Background

This project is part of the Code Institute February 2023 Hackathon. We researched World NGO Day and found that it aims to appreciate different NGOs across the world, and so decided that having a directory where users can browse different NGOs, perhaps filtering by region or type, would help users to find more specific information or bring awareness to different NGOs. It can also help users to find NGOs which they would like to be a part of or contribute towards.
