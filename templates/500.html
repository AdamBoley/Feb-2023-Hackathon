<!-- 
    This page is for when the server or application encounters an error, i.e HTTP status code 500
    A message to the user reflecting this and a link back to the homepage are all that is needed
    use:
    <a href="{% url 'home' %}">Back to home</a>
    The stuff in the href is how django navigates between pages
