<!-- 
    This page is for when the app cannot find a page, such as when a user mistypes a URL, i.e HTTP status code 404
    A message to the user reflecting this and a link back to the homepage are all that is needed
    use:
    <a href="{% url 'home' %}">Back to home</a>
    The stuff in the href is how django navigates between pages
